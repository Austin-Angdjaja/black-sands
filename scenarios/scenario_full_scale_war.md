# SCENARIO: FULL-SCALE WAR
> This scenario is evaluated independant of moral, ideological, or normative considerations.

## DEFINITION
This scenario assumes the Iranian leadership elects to pursue sustained, direct, military confrontation against Israel and the United States, with expectation that escalation can be endured or leveraged to better Iran's strategic position.

Implicit market assumptions primarily include:
- Iran is willing to sustain prolonged military and economic damage.
- Iran can deter or withstand direct, military involvement from the United States.
- Escalation improves Iran's negotiating position rather than accelerating existential regime risk.

This scenario underscores forecasts of prolonged, regional conflict and sustained oil price dislocation.

## PREREQUISITES
For this scenario to prove probable, the following conditions must maintain:

**POLITICAL**
- Iranian leadership must prioritize confrontation as demanded by revolutionist ideals over regime continuity.
- Domestic governance and integrity must remain intact and unweakened amidst sustained military and economic pressure.

**MILITARY**
- Iran must possess sufficient military capability to contest Israeli forces while deterring or absorbing U.S escalation.
- Command-and-control centers must remain fully operational under precision strikes.

**ECONOMIC**
- Iran must possess the economic capability to withstand further sanctions, blockades, embargoes, infrastructure damage, and capital flight.
- Channels for export must remain sufficiently intact.

**DIPLOMATIC**
- Regional actors or parties of interest must remain neutral or restrained.
- No rapid formation of an international coalition against Iran.

## CONSTRAINT COLLISION

**POLITICAL CONSTRAINT**

A prolonged, full-scale conflict fuels political instability and creates openings for both internal and external actors to exploit regime fragility. A protracted war also breeds dissent within the general populace, further compounding internal struggles.

**MILITARY CONSTRAINT**

Iran faces overwhelming asymmetry against Israel backed by United States air, intelligence, and strike capabilities. Prolonged confrontation deteriorates Iran's already weakened military, infrastructure, and strategic assets. Attrition favors the opposition. Further, full-scale war converts a bilateral conflict into a multilateral one. U.S involvement materially increases the possibility of allied participation or an international coalition intervening.

**ECONOMIC CONSTRAINT**

Iran's economy operates under evergreen sanctions and limited absorption capabilities. Escalation further isolates the country and disrupts remaining trade channels, leading to economic stress that directly fuels political instability.

**DIPLOMATIC CONSTRAINT**

Neighboring states tolerate Iran's behavior under managed escalation. Full-scale war removes ambiguity and pressures regional actors / parties to align against Iran to protect economic and security interests.

## REGIME SURVIVAL TEST
This scenario materially increases existential risk to the Islamic regime by:
- Exposing senior military and clerical leadership to repeated targeting.
- Accelerating domestic dissatisfaction, populace dissent, and insurgency / rebellion under economic pressure, political instability, and security strain.
- Pursuing direct confrontation with a coalition capable of regime-threatening escalation.

Historical precedent under both Khomeini and Khamenei governance demonstrates a willingness to deviate from revolutionary ideology when presented with regime-threatening risks, and opt for strategic compromise.

Even partial escalation may result in:
- Loss of escalation control as U.S involvement expands beyond original, operational scope.
- Rapid deterioration of Iran's deterrence credibility.
- Increased probability of internal revolt / unrest driven by economic strain, security stress, and political instability.
- Narrowing of diplomatic exit ramps / strategic pull-back options as coalition pressure intensifies.

## VIABILITY ASSESSMENT
This scenario proves infeasible.

The combination of severe military asymmetry, coalition escalation risk, and direct threats to regime continuity render full-scale war a non-dominant path under rational leadership.
