# SCENARIO: HORMUZ STRAIT CLOSURE
> This scenario is evaluated independent of moral, ideological, or normative considerations.

## DEFINITION
This scenario assumes Iranian leadership elects to disrupt, partial or otherwise, outbound trade via the Strait of Hormuz as a retaliatory measure following Israeli and U.S. escalation, with the intent of exerting economic pressure on global markets and forcing diplomatic concessions.

Implicit market assumptions include:
- Iran possesses the operational and military capability to sustain a meaningful disruption of Hormuz.
- Iran can withstand direct military retaliation resulting from such escalation.
- Economic pressure generated by global oil market dislocation improves Iran's strategic negotiating position.
- Regional states and actors tolerate or remain neutral towards Iran despite interference with critical energy infrastructure and potential loss of major trade channels.

This scenario underscores forecasts of acute oil supply shocks as a result of the Hormuz Strait closure.

## PREREQUISITES
For this scenario to prove probable, the following conditions must maintain:

**POLITICAL**
- Iranian leadership must accept elevated, existential regime risk in exchange for potential economic leverage.
- Domestic governance and political stability must remain intact despite prolonged economic and military pressure.

**MILITARY**
- Iran must be able to meaningfully disrupt maritime traffic through military means while defending ground, sea, and air assets involved in the operation.
- Iran must deter or absorb rapid multinational naval and air response.

**ECONOMIC**
- Iran must be able to withstand total or near-total loss of remaining oil export revenues.
- Further sanctions must be survivable over a prolonged period.

**DIPLOMATIC**
- Regional actors in the region must be willing to tolerate disruption to their own energy exports and trade routes.
- Major energy importers must refrain from decisive intervention.

## CONSTRAINT COLLISION

**POLITICAL CONSTRAINT**

A Hormuz Strait disruption directly impacts energy security of major players including the United States, Europe, China, and other such major Asian economies. Pursuing this scenario guarantees rapid formation of an international coalition with both political and military mandate to restore operationality of the strait.

**MILITARY CONSTRAINT**

Protracted closure of the Hormuz Strait requires continuous efforts under conditions of overwhelming surveillance, air superiority, and naval dominance by U.S. and potential coalition allied forces. Attempts at disruption are easily identifiable and targetable.

**ECONOMIC CONSTRAINT**

Blocking Hormuz eliminates Iran's remaining energy export revenue whilst accelerating international isolation. Economic pain is asymmetric and instant for Iran, whilst distributed / absorbable for importing nations through strategic reserves and coordinated response.

**DIPLOMATIC CONSTRAINT**

Multiple neighboring countries and regional actors rely on the strait for their own economic survival. Disruptions caused to the Hormuz Strait is likely to force Gulf states to abandon strategic ambiguity and align against Iran to protect national interests.

## REGIME SURVIVAL TEST
This scenario materially increases existential risk to the Iranian Islamic regime by:
- Triggering overwhelming, multinational military response.
- Eliminating remaining economic lifelines and revenue.
- Converting tolerant regional actors into active opposition.

Historical precedent under both Khomeini and Khamenei governance demonstrates Iranian leadership avoids actions which may otherwise unify external powers / parties whilst threatening regime continuity.

Even partial escalation may result in:
- Rapid coalition, military response neutralizing strait blockade.
- Expanded sanctions.
- Loss of diplomatic leverage.
- Loss of potential regional alliances.
- Material risk of political instability and internal unrest, driven by economic collapse.

## VIABILITY ASSESSMENT
The combination of operational unsustainability, guaranteed coalition response, economic collapse, and direct threats to regime continuity renders closure of the Hormuz strait a non-dominant path under rational leadership.

> This scenario fails under regime survival logic outlined in [Regime Survival Logic](/framework/regime_survival_logic.md).
