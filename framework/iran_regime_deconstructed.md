# IRAN'S REGIME DECONSTRUCTED

This file intends to deconstruct the Iranian Islamic regime and provide an overview of the leadership's survival logic, decision making rationale, and failure conditions.

## IRAN'S REGIME SURVIVAL LOGIC

### CORE
**"The Islamic Regime survives."**

> Regime survival is the dominant objective. All economic, military, diplomatic, and ideological actions are subordinated to it under existential threat. Cooperation / compromise with the enemy is tolerable if the alternative results in permanent regime implosion.
>
> 1988 Iran-Iraq War: Despite ideological commitment to continued resistance and territorial claims, Khomeini ultimately accepted a UN-brokered ceasefire. Prolonging the war materially threatened regime collapse due to economic exhaustion, military attrition, populace discontent, etc...


### SUB-CORE I
**"Internal control first, external image second."**

> Loss of reputation or image internationally is deemed acceptable; loss of stability or control domestically is not. This sub-core explains why Iran tolerates:
> - Persistent sanctions.
> - Covert, "closed-doors" compromises.
> - Proxy throttling.
> 
> But never tolerates:
> - Security force / military disloyalty.
> - Population dissent.
> - Clerical / elite / leadership fragmentation.
>
> June 2009 Green Movement Crackdown: Mass protests erupted as a result of contested election results. The Islamic regime mobilized the Basij, IRGC, and plainsclothes units alike to suppress said protests. Methods of suppression include: widespread arrests, control and censorship of media, imprisonment of opposition leaders, sniper killings, etc...

### SUB-CORE II
**"Asymmetry is exploited, not challenged."**

> Iran specifically avoids symmetric confrontation with an equal / superior force unless regime survival is already lost. This explains why Iran relies on:
> - Proxy forces.
> - Deniability.
> - Grey-zone warfare.
>
> Full-scale war, especially with a superior force, remains non-dominant as it exposes Iran to the possibility of infrastructure damage, economic collapse, leadership targeting, military loss, and more importantly, regime extinction. Conflict against Israel and other such regional actors is acceptable; conflict against the United States or an international coalition is not.
>
> Hezbollah v. Israel, 2006: Iran provided proxy support rather than deploying boots-on-the-ground, direct forces. Such asymmetric tactics preserved deniability and prevented escalation with Israel or external forces.

### SUB-CORE III
**"Deterrence is not religion."**

> Deterrence may be conditionally sacrificed / scaled down if preserving it materially threatens regime survival. A maneuver, which may seem irrational to outsiders, may be deemed internally optimal and opted for if maintaining the alternative increases existential risk. Ambiguous nuclear capability is seen as acceptable, overt weaponization draws coalition risk, while actual use results in definite regime suicide. Iran differentiates sharply between the three, and actively arbitrages the distinction.
>
> Post-Soleimani 2020 Era: Iran retaliated against a U.S. strike, but avoided direct escalations which might otherwise trigger war with coalition forces. The limited missile strikes was a balancing act between deterrence credibility and regime survival.

### SUB-CORE IV
**"Time as an asset."**

> Iran prefers strategies that do not resolve immediately. Strategies which buy time, delay coalition formation, and defer irreversible decisions are preferred. Ceasefires, strategic pull-backs, general ambiguity, and diplomatic noise are all viable time-buying instruments.
>
> Post-Iraq Invasion, 2003: Instead of confronting U.S. forces directly in Iraq, Iran instead cultivated influence via proxies. The intent was to wait out U.S. military fatigue and domestic pressure overseas to reduce exposure.

## IRAN'S REGIME FAILURE CONDITIONS

### CONDITION I
**"Elite Fragmentation."**

> Iran's regime is able to maintain stability due to its clerical, military, and elite cohesiveness; fragmentation leads to infighting and general instability. A severe enough power / position vacuum leads to the same conclusion. It is for this very reason that Israel specifically targets the Iranian clerical / military leadership with precision strikes. Iran, as a nation, may survive a fragmented elite class, however, the Islamic regime, as a controlling party, can not.
>
> 1981-1983 saw Iran's leadership devolve into factionalism. Purges were seen as necessary to restore internal alignment and regime survival.

### CONDITION II
**"Loss of Force."**

> The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) serves as Iran's elite branch of military, loyal to the supreme leader and Islamic regime. The IRGC's function includes: protecting regime continuity, enforcing ideology, policing internal dissent, etc... Loss of IRGC command coherence invites population dissent and authority decay; general security force defections likewise. The Islamic regime requires a functioning, and more importantly obedient, internal and external force upon which projection of authority is possible.
>
> Suppression during the 2009 Green Movement relied on IRGC and Basij capabilities. Absent both forces, protests might have escalated and resulted in a regime coup.

### CONDITION III
**"Mass unrest."**

> Iran possesses the capability to police individual clusters of dissent, but not persistent, mass unrest across multiple cities at once. Rebellion, insurgency, or riots may form due to food / fuel distribution failure, hyperinflation spirals, prolonged conflict, loss of security, etc...
>
> 2019 saw Iran raise fuel prices by 50% ~ 200% and introduced nation-wide rationing. Protests erupted in 100+ cities. The Islamic regime avoided total collapse by rapidly deploying security and throttling internet usage. Mass unrest is tolerated only in small pockets. A true-scale, nation-wide unrest is seen as existential to the regime.

## IRAN'S DECISION HIERARCHY UNDER STRESS
1. Preserve internal security and clerical / military / elite cohesion.
2. Prevent irreversible, external escalation.
3. Maintain minimum economic viability.
4. Preserve deterrence capabilities.

Only when all the above are satisfied will Iran:

5. Maintain ideological narrative.

## APPLICATION RULE
Any scenario that materially accelerates elite fragmentation, degrades Iranian force capability, or triggers sustained, multi-city unrest without offering commensurate payoff fails regime survival logic and is therefore, non-dominant.
